hppserv
=======

Small attempt at a complete HTTP Proxy Server written
in Python by using and extending the Standard Library
elements like BaseHTTPServer

For Python >= 2.7 (maybe 2.6)

Many of the concepts need to be reworked to make it
a good example and needs some cleaning up from
patches and experiments in the code, but it works
though
